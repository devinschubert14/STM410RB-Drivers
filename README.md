# STM410RB-Drivers
Serial communication drivers for the STM32-F410RB board in C. This source library acts as a Hardware Abstraction Layer for the GPIO, SPI, I2C, and USART peripheral registers on the STM32-F410RB microcontroller board.

For information on how to use the functions, use the provided function descriptions in the source code.

This code is heavily inspired from the following course since I coded along with the lectures on Udemy: [Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/).
